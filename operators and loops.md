# Operators and Loops

Boolean: true or false

## == (equal to).
This operator compares two values (numbers, string, or Booleans) to see if they are the same.
Ex: **'Negative' == 'Positive'** returns false cause they're not the same string
Ex: **'Negative' == 'Negative'** returns true cause they're the same string

## != (is not equal to)
This operator compares two values to see if they are not the same.
Ex: **'Negative' == 'Positive'** returns true cause they're not the same string
Ex: **'Negative' == 'Negative'** returns false cause they're the same string

=== (strict equal to)
This operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same.
Ex: **'7' === 7** returns false cause they are not the same data type or value
Ex: **'7' === '7'** returns true cause they are the same data type and value

!== (strict not equal to
This operator compares two values to check hat both the data type and value are not the same.
Ex: **'7' === 7** returns true cause they are not the same data type or value
Ex: **'7' === '7'** returns true cause they are not the same data type and value

> (Greater than)
This operator checks to see if the number on the left is greater than the number on the Right
10 > 9 returns true
9 > 10 returns false


< (Less than)
This operator checks to see if the number on the left is less than the number on the Right
10 < 9 returns false
9 < 10 returns true

>= (Greater than or Equal to)
This operator checks to see if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the Right
10 >= 9 returns true
9 >= 10 returns false
10 >= 10 returns true

<= (Less than or Equal to)
This operator checks to see if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the Right
10 <= 9 returns false
9 <= 10 returns true
10 <= 10 returns true
