# How Computers Work
This was a series of videos explaining the basic overview of computers. Some pretty interesting stuff.

What Makes a Computer a Computer?
4 primary functions:
**input
Store
Process
Output**

Binary & Data
This was the most interesting video, maybe because I had totally forgotten the binary number system
Binary is: 1 or 0, on or off, true or false
this comprises a bit
The number of inputs is dependent upon the number of wires.
8 wires = 256 possible outputs
32 wires = over 4 billion!
This video explained how text, sound, and video into numbers. Super fascinating
Circuits & Logic This was also a pretty intersting video, while they didn't mention it, but I finally began to understand Moore's Law. The smaller things are, the faster the data goes, the more data can be processed.
CPU, Memory, Input/Output
