## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/albemedina/Reading-Notes/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

The growth mindset to me is like committment. There are going to be distractions and blocks on your journey that will hinder it. You just have to want it so bad that nothing else matters.
1st reminder in my growth mindset is to try and find the positive in something from this program. It's going to be difficult but if there's a good outlook that i can find I know I will be able to do it.
2nd is learning from my peers. Nobody is perfect and there is something that you can learn from your peers that you may not know yourself. Never be afraid to ask questions. You could find the answer your looking for.
3rd is putting in effort. Life doesn't simply give hand outs. Like a dream body you want you have to put the effort in the gym and outside the gym whether that be your diet, sleep. etc.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/albemedina/Reading-Notes/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
