### Definition of Growth
## The growth mindset to me is like committment. There are going to be distractions and blocks on your journey that will hinder it. You just have to want it so bad that nothing else matters.
### Markdown

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
### 3 Daily reminders for my self growth
## 1st reminder in my growth mindset is to try and find the positive in something from this program. It's going to be difficult but if there's a good outlook that i can find I know I will be able to do it.
## 2nd is learning from my peers. Nobody is perfect and there is something that you can learn from your peers that you may not know yourself. Never be afraid to ask questions. You could find the answer your looking for.
## 3rd is putting in effort. Life doesn't simply give hand outs. Like a dream body you want you have to put the effort in the gym and outside the gym whether that be your diet, sleep. etc.
