## Step by Step
### Recipes
 With what goes on in the chapters that we have read for this lesson. The goal for javascript is to make  the website has user interactive as you want it to make it.
 There's alot of examples that Javascript is compaared to. *Ex. cooking* you can make the script with one individual scenario like a one course meal and be done with it.

Linking JS
When adding JavaScript to your program, you want to make sure to be able to link your page to your HTML page. As HTML reads from top to bottom, you want to place this near your CSS link for JS to run everything as the page is being rendered.

When linking, you want to make sure, in your JS to mention and write out where you want your JS actions to take place. Wether that be in the beginning, or in certain tags throughout the whole page. Example of this would be, if you wanted JS to make sure they displayed the personâ€™s Birthday in the correct spot, you want to make sure the tag is correct or else the Birthday could be displayed in a random place, or no where if HTML does not know where you want this specific action to take place at.

Comments
Comments are very useful to descibe what is happening in the program. Sometimes it can be difficult to see what it happening at a glace, but making a small comment on what is going on makes understanding your code, and makes other people reading your code very easy as well.

One other thing that commenting is very good for is how when making a function or script. Commenting on what is going on, as in writing everything out on a whtie board before tackling the problem can make things very easy, as everything is on paper for you to outline and follow through with.
