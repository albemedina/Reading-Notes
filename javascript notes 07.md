# Javascript

## Step by Step
### Recipes
 With what goes on in the chapters that we have read for this lesson. The goal for javascript is to make  the website has user interactive as you want it to make it.
 There's alot of examples that Javascript is compaared to. *Ex. cooking* you can make the script with one individual scenario like a one course meal and be done with it.

Linking JS
When adding JavaScript to your program, you want to make sure to be able to link your page to your HTML page. As HTML reads from top to bottom, you want to place this near your CSS link for JS to run everything as the page is being rendered.

When linking, you want to make sure, in your JS to mention and write out where you want your JS actions to take place. Wether that be in the beginning, or in certain tags throughout the whole page. Example of this would be, if you wanted JS to make sure they displayed the personâ€™s Birthday in the correct spot, you want to make sure the tag is correct or else the Birthday could be displayed in a random place, or no where if HTML does not know where you want this specific action to take place at.

Comments
Comments are very useful to descibe what is happening in the program. Sometimes it can be difficult to see what it happening at a glace, but making a small comment on what is going on makes understanding your code, and makes other people reading your code very easy as well.

One other thing that commenting is very good for is how when making a function or script. Commenting on what is going on, as in writing everything out on a whtie board before tackling the problem can make things very easy, as everything is on paper for you to outline and follow through with.


# JavaScript Variable
Variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime.

## JavaScript uses reserved keyword var to declare a variable. A variable must have a unique name. You can assign a value to a variable using equal to (=) operator when you declare it or before using it.
var <variable-name>;

var <variable-name> = <value>;
 
# Javascript Operators
JavaScript includes operators as in other languages. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. For example 1 + 2, where + sign is an operator and 1 is left operand and 2 is right operand. + operator adds two numeric values and produces a result which is 3 in this case.
JavaScript includes following categories of operators.

+ Arithmetic Operators - Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations between numeric operands.
+ Comparison Operators - JavaScript language includes operators that compare two operands and return Boolean value true or false.
+ Logical Operators - Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions. JavaScript includes following logical operators.
+ Assignment Operators - JavaScript includes assignment operators to assign values to variables with less key strokes
+ Conditional Operators - JavaScript includes special operator called ternary operator :? that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition. This is like short form of if-else condition.

# Data types
+ String- String is a primitive data type in JavaScript. A string is textual content. It must be enclosed in single or double quotation marks.
+ Number- The Number is a primitive data type in JavaScript. Number type represents integer, float, hexadecimal, octal or exponential value. First character in a Number type must be an integer value and it must not be enclosed in quotation marks.
+ Boolean- Boolean is a primitive data type in JavaScript. Boolean can have only two values, true or false. It is useful in controlling program flow using conditional statements like if..else, switch, while, do..while.
+ Object- Object is a non-primitive data type in JavaScript. It is like any other variable, the only difference is that an object holds multiple values in terms of properties and methods. Properties can hold values of primitive data types and methods are functions.
+ Date- JavaScript provides Date object to work with date & time including days, months, years, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.
+ Array- An array is a special type of variable, which can store multiple values using special syntax. Every value is associated with numeric index starting with 0. The following figure illustrates how an array stores values.
+ null - Null You can assign null to a variable to denote that currently that variable does not have any value but it will have later on. A null means absence of a value.
